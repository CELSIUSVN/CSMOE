## 🎮 What is CSMOE?

**CSMOE (Counter-Strike: Mobile Oriented Edition)** is a fan-made modification built on the **Xash3D Engine**, based on **Counter-Strike 1.6**.  
It aims to **recreate the classic gameplay experience** of **Counter-Strike Online (CSO)** and **Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio (CSN:S / CSN:Z)** — optimized for both **PC and Android** platforms.

## 🌐 Why an English Patch?

The original version of CSMOE was released **entirely in Chinese**.  
Due to past incidents where the game was **pirated and resold** in China (similar to CSSME and CSBTE), the developers decided **not to release** the latest version publicly.  

However, with **official permission** from the CSMOE developers, community contributor **ssya** has created and released this **English translation patch** to make the game more accessible globally.
