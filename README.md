What is CSMOE?
CSMOE is a modified game based on the Xash3D Engine and a modification of Counter-Strike 1.6. It was developed to recreate the feel of Counter-Strike Online (CSO) and Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio (CSN:S or CSN:Z).

Why Translate?
CSMOE is entirely in Chinese. The game was once pirated and illegally resold in the Chinese market (a similar situation also occurred with CSSME and CSBTE), so the developers decided not to open source the latest version. However, ssya has received official permission to release this translated patch.

Legality
This patch has been officially approved by the CSMOE developers.
It does not violate any applicable distribution rules.
